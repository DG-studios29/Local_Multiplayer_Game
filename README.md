# Local_Multiplayer_Game

Game Idea (Overview) 
A fast-paced, 3D local multiplayer game where players control unique hero characters battling against each other while managing hordes of spawned soldiers. Players fight to survive and outlast their opponents by using their hero's abilities, collecting power-ups, and strategically deploying units to overwhelm enemy players. The game features a shared screen, encouraging intense cooperative and competitive action. 
Game Mechanics
Hero Abilities:
Each hero has 3 unique abilities, including offensive, defensive, and utility skills.
Abilities have cooldowns, and using them effectively is key to survival.
Combo System:
Chain hero abilities with summoned units for powerful effects (e.g., casting a freeze ability on enemies while summoning attack for bonus damage).
Players will have a set amount of time to win, so this battle will be timed. If they are unable to win in the allotted time, they will have to fight it out in a sudden death match without any abilities. 
Experience & Leveling:
Players gain XP from kills and objectives.
Leveling up boosts stats and grants ability upgrades or new passive perks.
Resource Management:
Players must balance spending resources on summoning units versus upgrading their hero.
Power-ups and map objectives can provide resource boosts.
Arena Events:
Timed events add more chaos, like sudden boss spawns, environmental hazards, or area buffs.

Camera: 
Third- person (Top Down) - zoomed out view 
Follows all the players and adjust dynamically
Camera will zoom in and out tracking the players.
Movement: 
Walk and dash.
The dash shouldn’t be infinite so as to avoid players from running and ultimately cause the game to run indefinitely
The dash will serve as a safety net, giving the player a means of escape in case of emergency or a means of approaching their adversaries.
UI and HUD
Health, Stamina, && energy bars.
Summon cooldowns and resources meters.
Will also have a timer for the match.
Sound Design 
Distinct ability sound effects for each hero
Summoning sound cues to make it clear when a player perform a summon (i.e. How they did in Hogwarts Legacy when the mc performs/ casts a spell)
Gameplay Loop
Hero Selection: Players choose their hero and customize “loadouts”.
Match Start: Players spawn into a shared arena, with a brief prep phase to explore and gather initial power-ups.
Combat Phase:

Killing enemies grants experience and resources.
Resources can be spent to summon units.
Summoning & Strategy: Players decide when and where to summon units to pressure rivals or defend key areas.

Hero Design
Hero Attributes: Health, Speed, Attack Power, Summon Limit, Ability Cooldowns
Abilities: 3-4 unique abilities per hero (e.g., AoE attacks, healing zones, teleportation, unit buffs)
Hero Roles: 
Example Hero Concepts:
Blaze Knight: Fire-themed warrior who summons fiery minions and leaves burning trails.
Storm Caller: Lightning mage who summons storm spirits and electrifies areas.
Shadow Assassin: Stealthy rogue who can teleport and summon shadow clones.
Summoning System
The summoning system is a core mechanic, adding a layer of strategy and resource management to the chaotic combat. Players can summon various types of AI-controlled units to aid them in battle, with deeper mechanics to allow for advanced strategies.
Unit Types:
Melee Warriors: Durable frontline fighters with high health but low speed.
Ranged Archers: Fragile units that deal damage from a distance.
Tanks: Slow-moving units with massive health pools, ideal for absorbing damage.
Support Casters: Units that heal allies, buff heroes, or debuff enemy units.
Summon Costs:
Defeated enemies and rival summons drop resources.
Resources can be spent to summon units or upgrade existing ones.
Summons have a cooldown, preventing spam.
Unit Evolution & Upgrades:
Units can be upgraded mid-match, transforming into stronger versions.
Players can choose from multiple upgrade paths (e.g., turning an archer into a sniper or a crossbow wielder with AoE shots).


Summon Synergies:
Certain units synergize with each other (e.g., summoning fire mages alongside flame elementals boosts fire damage for both).
Hero abilities can enhance summons (e.g., a lightning mage empowering summoned golems with chain lightning).
Summon Placement & AI:
Summons can be placed strategically, either spawning next to the hero or at designated spawn points.
AI behavior can be modified with simple commands (e.g., attack closest enemy, defend the hero, focus rival summons).
















Progression & Meta Systems
Hero & Summon Unlocks:
New heroes and summon types can be unlocked by completing challenges, winning matches, or accumulating in-game currency.
Ability Augments:
Unlock permanent ability modifiers (e.g., a fireball that explodes twice, or a healing ability that also grants shields).
Summon Loadouts:
Customize your starting summon roster and their upgrade paths before a match.
Loadouts encourage varied strategies (e.g., swarming with weak units or focusing on a few elite summons).
Hero Customization:
Unlock hero skins, voice packs, and summon appearance variants.
Visual upgrades for abilities, like changing element types (e.g., turning ice shards into crystalline spears).
Progression Tiers:
Divide progression into tiers, with each tier unlocking more powerful heroes, summons, and match modifiers.
Challenges & Achievements:
Encourage replayability with unique challenges (e.g., win a match without summoning, or survive for 20 minutes solo).
